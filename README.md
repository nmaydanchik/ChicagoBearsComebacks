# Chicago Bears Comeback Analysis

## A Data Driven Investigation of Main Drivers of Chicago Bears Comebacks

This repository contains the materials of my data science project where I analyzed play-by-play data to determine **the driving factors behind the Chicago Bears' six comebacks during the first 17 weeks of the 2025 season.**

This project highlights my ability to:
- Collect and process data
- Reconcile my data with other available statistics
- Plan and execute a multi-stage data analysis
- Manipulate and analyze data in R (tidyverse)
- Generate clear data visualizations (ggplot2, patchwork)
- Communicate findings in writing
- Carry out a robust data science project from start to finish in a short time frame

My full write-up is in the repository as a pdf and is available at [website].

## Key Findings

- **Main Drivers of successful comebacks**: Increased offensive efficiency driven by explosive plays and improved yards per catch, big special teams plays
- **Reasons for unsuccessful comebacks**: Poor performances by defense and special teams despite solid performance by offense
