# Chicago Bears Comeback Analysis

## A Data Driven Investigation of Main Drivers of Chicago Bears Comebacks

This repository contains the materials of my data science project where I analyzed play-by-play data to determine **the driving factors behind the Chicago Bears' six comebacks during the first 17 weeks of the 2025 season.**

Project Dates: 12/17/25-12/31/25 (Freshman -- UCLA)

This project highlights my ability to:

* Collect and process data
* Reconcile my data with other available statistics
* Strategically plan and execute a multi-stage data analysis
* Manipulate and analyze data in R (tidyverse)
* Generate clear data visualizations (ggplot2, patchwork)
* Communicate findings in writing
* Carry out a robust data science project from start to finish in a short time frame

My full write-up is in the repository as BearsComebacksArticle.pdf and is available at https://medium.com/@nmaydanchik06/the-driving-factors-behind-the-chicago-bears-miracle-comeback-wins-fd5321845be2.

## Key Findings

* **Main Drivers of successful comebacks**: Increased offensive efficiency driven by explosive plays and improved yards per catch, big special teams plays
* **Reasons for unsuccessful comebacks**: Poor performances by defense and special teams despite solid performance by offense
